// Design an 8-bit RPG hero pickler. That is devise an encoding and decoding of a "hero" into an 8-bit integer (a char).
// Based loosely on the game "Lasers & Feelings"


// Provide a function for asking someone to create their hero and at the end tell them their 8-bit sequence.


// Provide a function which takes in an 8-bit sequence and displays the pertinent information about that hero.


// Give me an 8-bit hero which you think Grace Hopper might have picked.
